Eventually humans expanded into less hot and sunlit areas allowing for the survival and procreation of people who developed lighter colored eyes and skin because of the lack of need of melanin for survival .'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":40}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# test tokenizer\n","\n","roberta_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"roberta-base\")\n","text = \"Hello everyone!\"\n","vocab = {v:k for k,v in roberta_tokenizer.vocab.items()}\n","\n","print([(id, vocab[id]) for id in roberta_tokenizer(text)['input_ids']])\n","print([(id, vocab[id]) for id in roberta_tokenizer(ds['train'][3]['human_answers'][0])['input_ids']])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"AXoEYbXhyr__","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1695769549190,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":803,"user":{"displayName":"Jooyong Lee","userId":"03355881400877097792"}},"outputId":"902fcbe1-7315-44b3-c6e7-7d267de0b939"},"execution_count":41,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[(0, '<s>'), (31414, 'Hello'), (961, 'Ġeveryone'), (328, '!'), (2, '</s>')]\n","[(0, '<s>'), (1185, 'You'), (6056, 'Ġca'), (295, 'Ġn'), (75, \"'t\"), (95, 'Ġjust'), (213, 'Ġgo'), (198, 'Ġaround'), (39257, 'Ġassass'), (15647, 'inating'), (5, 'Ġthe'), (917, 'Ġleaders'), (9, 'Ġof'), (749, 'Ġcountries'), (47, 'Ġyou'), (109, 'Ġdo'), (295, 'Ġn'), (90, 't'), (101, 'Ġlike'), (27785, 'Ġ!'), (20, 'ĠThe'), (758, 'Ġinternational'), (19973, 'Ġcondemnation'), (74, 'Ġwould'), (28, 'Ġbe'), (8513, 'Ġbrutal'), (479, 'Ġ.'), (1648, 'ĠEven'), (600, 'Ġthough'), (117, 'Ġno'), (1264, 'one'), (3829, 'Ġlikes'), (1636, 'ĠKim'), (6465, 'ĠJong'), (111, 'Ġ-'), (1890, 'ĠUn'), (2156, 'Ġ,'), (8, 'Ġand'), (961, 'Ġeveryone'), (4265, 'Ġthinks'), (369, 'ĠNorth'), (1101, 'ĠKorea'), (16, 'Ġis'), (1256, 'Ġpretty'), (43816, 'Ġshitty'), (7, 'Ġto'), (63, 'Ġits'), (2286, 'Ġcitizens'), (2156, 'Ġ,'), (114, 'Ġif'), (224, 'Ġsay'), (5, 'Ġthe'), (382, 'ĠUS'), (58, 'Ġwere'), (7, 'Ġto'), (2142, 'Ġsend'), (3525, 'Ġagents'), (81, 'Ġover'), (36, 'Ġ('), (8, 'Ġand'), (109, 'Ġdo'), (295, 'Ġn'), (75, \"'t\"), (206, 'Ġthink'), (51, 'Ġthey'), (32, 'Ġare'), (295, 'Ġn'), (75, \"'t\"), (4453, 'Ġcapable'), (9, 'Ġof'), (24, 'Ġit'), (4839, 'Ġ)'), (8, 'Ġand'), (51, 'Ġthey'), (300, 'Ġgot'), (2037, 'Ġcaught'), (39574, 'Ġ....'), (358, 'Ġevery'), (247, 'Ġcountry'), (2156, 'Ġ,'), (358, 'Ġevery'), (232, 'Ġworld'), (884, 'Ġleader'), (74, 'Ġwould'), (28, 'Ġbe'), (10, 'Ġa'), (801, 'Ġpotential'), (1002, 'Ġtarget'), (479, 'Ġ.'), (3394, 'ĠWho'), (128, \"Ġ'\"), (29, 's'), (220, 'Ġnext'), (1666, 'Ġ...'), (12104, 'ĠCastro'), (17487, 'Ġ?'), (7693, 'ĠAngela'), (6580, 'ĠMerkel'), (17487, 'Ġ?'), (5053, 'ĠAny'), (5924, 'ways'), (2156, 'Ġ,'), (11122, 'Ġrum'), (2126, 'our'), (34, 'Ġhas'), (24, 'Ġit'), (14, 'Ġthat'), (37, 'Ġhe'), (128, \"Ġ'\"), (29, 's'), (9620, 'Ġultra'), (33554, 'Ġparanoid'), (59, 'Ġabout'), (2230, 'Ġexactly'), (14, 'Ġthat'), (8, 'Ġand'), (12524, 'Ġtravels'), (198, 'Ġaround'), (11, 'Ġin'), (12039, 'Ġtanks'), (8, 'Ġand'), (35113, 'Ġarmoured'), (7717, 'Ġtrains'), (14, 'Ġthat'), (146, 'Ġmake'), (8300, 'ĠLim'), (139, 'o'), (112, 'Ġ1'), (356, 'Ġlook'), (101, 'Ġlike'), (10, 'Ġa'), (4866, 'Ġton'), (2348, 'ka'), (10771, 'Ġtoy'), (479, 'Ġ.'), (2, '</s>')]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2.
